# Sort-Numbers-Task

A simple application, written using python and the Flask framework,
that takes in a list of numbers, sorts them based upon user preference, returns the sorted list along with sort preference
and time of sort.This is information is uploaded to a database written using python's sqlite3 package. Database contents 
can be downloaded to JSON format.


The project is written in Python and adheres to, where possible, an OOP methodology, in order to maintain modularity and loose coupling. The 
implementation of this strategy might not have been executed as effectively as possible, but it played a decisive role in the design of the program.

The project assumes that the user is able to run python on their local machine and
install the requisite dependencies, which are included in [_requirements.txt_](requirements.txt).
